      Dyslexia Awareness Week
    </h2>
    <p class="text-white">
      Throughout DAW24, I assisted in social media management. This week saw a
      record amount of engagement from likes, comments and shares, to increased
      website traffic. This was great for the continued effort in awareness.
      <br /><br />
      Part of my strategy was using graphics designed with purpose for each aim
      of the campaign, and posting these regularly at peak engagement times -
      and of course using hashtags and CTAs! Combining effective design and
      social media strategies made for an impactful week, connecting with
      existing and new audiences through quotes, statistics, and sponsors.

      Website Analytics
    </h2>
    <p class="text-white mb-5">
      Both in my professional roles and personal projects, I employ Google Tag
      Manager with Google Analytics into my websites and social media platforms.
      This gives me invaluable insight to traffic, actions taken, and any issues
      experienced. Many times I have been surprised at the data found, such as
      international interest and popular interactions, giving me a greater
      understanding of reach.
